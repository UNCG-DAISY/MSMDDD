The repository for Mining Social Media Data During Disasters (MSMDDD). This is in support of the paper titled - 'A multi-modal approach towards mining social media data during natural disasters - a case study of Hurricane Irma'

This repository has 4 directories for the four models used in the analysis:
- GIS (scoring_gis)
- User (scoring_image)
- Text (scoring_text)

As well as a routine (tweet_to_json) to rehydrate/download the neccesary data from twitter given a list of tweetIDs.
